# Sonet.rs
**A TCP Implementation but written in Rust**

## Introduction
As many of you are aware of, Kotlin and Java bytecode needs the JVM to be executed. However, some projects should be able to run without any third-party software(python, ruby, nodejs, jvm... etc). So I decided to translate my [Sonet](https://github.com/dolphin2410/sonet) project to Rust.

## Warning
This is one of my earliest RUST projects. This project is currently under development, and you should **NEVER** execute it unless you know what you are doing. **YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO EXPLOIT THIS LIBRARY**
